# Notes for future development

* Improve datatidy / runtidy 
  * make simple for running first time
  * Consolidate into one call 
    * cq-tidy - 
        * script which delegates to datatidy and runtidy
        * responsible for setting up datalog / runlog
* incorporate pre-staging to write inputs to scratch and post-staging to write outputs back to storage
    * post-staging could be responsibility of datatidy
        * post-staging could be just -x compress, but with a different output directory and without deletion
    * pre-staging would be in runplan, since that is responsible for writing YAML
        * directories staged based on case name
        * how to deal with commmon large files (reference?)
        * This script would presumably be responsible for cleaning up after successful completion?
* Clean up layout to incorporate restarts and de novo runs
* Fix cleanup in LSF
  * currently, -F does not work when submitted 
  * Simpler alternative is already implemented, where the job `bsub /bin/bash -c "cmd1 && cmd2"` is submitted.

    Getting different errors, continue debugging


# Previous notes
Implement basic non-db functionality (so that datatidy can be used)
Improve error handling if database does not exist / is down / is not correctly defined
Update documentation with description of local database
Think through where runlog and datalog files go.  Currently in ./logs, probably not the best place
Allow prune step to use arbitrary configuration file to define which files kept

Have a sense of "batches" or "generations" of runs.  Currently, when some runs fail, even after they're finalized, 
    `cq` will report that they are still failed.  This is confusing if they are being re-run.  Having an idea of 
    batches, or recognizing that a run has been finalized, will be helpful.
    One idea is to report in `cq` output whether runs have been finalized


Do a sanity check in runtidy to see if a UUID was passed instead of a case name
exit with an error if so
