Implement basic non-db functionality (so that datatidy can be used)
Improve error handling if database does not exist / is down / is not correctly defined
Update documentation with description of local database
Think through where runlog and datalog files go.  Currently in ./logs, probably not the best place
Allow prune step to use arbitrary configuration file to define which files kept
