Implement basic non-db functionality (so that datatidy can be used)
Improve error handling if database does not exist / is down / is not correctly defined
Update documentation with description of local database
Think through where runlog and datalog files go.  Currently in ./logs, probably not the best place
Allow prune step to use arbitrary configuration file to define which files kept

Have a sense of "batches" or "generations" of runs.  Currently, when some runs fail, even after they're finalized, 
    `cq` will report that they are still failed.  This is confusing if they are being re-run.  Having an idea of 
    batches, or recognizing that a run has been finalized, will be helpful.
    One idea is to report in `cq` output whether runs have been finalized
