compute1 branch has development work for preliminary runs on compute1.

Specifically,
* docker server startup and paths to project dirs will differ.
* Initial runs are manta
* Constructing docker image to run cromwell and CromwellRunner in ./docker
* moving cq-type code to ./src.  Motivation is to start separating out cq-code from
  TinDaisy to make it more general
