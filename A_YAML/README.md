# Case-list workflow
Typical workflow for creating YAML files based on list of cases

1. Create ../dat/cases.dat file which lists cases to run
2. Execute `bash 10_make_RUN_LIST.sh` to create
    `../dat/RUN_LIST.preliminary.dat`
3. Optionally exclude runs which have already been performed.  This is done with step `15_exclude_already_analyzed.sh`
   * if this step is not performed, then it is necessary to do the following,
    ```
        cd ../dat
        ln -s RUN_LIST.preliminary.dat RUN_LIST.dat
    ```
4. finally, run `bash 20_make_yaml.sh`.  This will create per-run configuration YAML files in the ../yaml directory.
   Review these files (spot checks, etc).

# Run-list workflow
Typical workflow when starting with a pre-generated RunList (RUNLIST9 format).  This is new for CPTAC3 work
Run list is automatically generated by https://github.com/ding-lab/CPTAC3.MissingAnalysis.git
Columns:
     1  disease
     2  run_name
     3  case
     4  datafile1_name
     5  datafile1_aliquot
     6  datafile1_uuid
     7  datafile2_name
     8  datafile2_aliquot
     9  datafile2_uuid

To be compatible with YAML creation, require the following columns (RUNLIST4 format)
    run_name
    case
    datafile1_uuid
    datafile2_uuid

This is done with step 20.  Note that the 9-column format Run list must be passed as an argument

Also, require that BamMap v3 format is available
