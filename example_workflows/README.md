Example workflows are in this directory.  These can be used for development or as starting points for production runs

* TinDaisy - variant caller
* TinDaisy.restart - restarting of tindaisy run from before merge step
* SomaticSV - running SomaticSV pipeline instead of TinDaisy

What's in here:
* Configuration files and scripts from past successful runs
  * original README files where appropriate
* Evolving toward templates to be used for similar runs in the future

In general, files which are retained in the above example workflow directories are those 
which are unique or modified for that workflow, and don't generally exist in ..
Idea is to minimize duplication.
