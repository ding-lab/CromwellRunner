# SomaticSV calling with CromwellRunner

SomaticSV uses an ad hoc BamMap since it is being run on CRAM files obtained from UMich

Building on (hopefully) successful run on SomaticSV here: /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/CWL/somatic_sv_workflow
    Branch cromwell

See for discussion of test processing of UMich data: 
    /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/CWL/somatic_sv_workflow/README.project.md

Data downloaded from storate1 onto here: /gscmnt/gc2521/dinglab/mwyczalk/CPTAC3.share
Reference: `GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla`

Prior work on katmai on SomaticSV (CRAM branch) was using a Rabix-based workflow.  This proved very slow,
so trying to move everything over to MGI and cromwell.  Initial testing of a single run on Cromwell is above.
Goal here is to have CromwellRunner successfully initialize, launch, and track SomaticSV runs.

To get started, we copied dat/BamMap.HNSCC.UMich.dat from katmai:/home/mwyczalk_test/Projects/SomaticSV/runs/HNSCC.CRAM.storage1/dat/BamMap.HNSCC.UMich.dat

This was generated by script like `10_make_BamMap.sh`.  We are manually editing this file as dat/BamMap.HNSCC.UMich.MGI.dat to modify paths
(in the future, just modify and run 10.  Currently, not all data downloaded so cannot rjun that script)
