## Cases to run:

* Test case - whatever is available as things are being copied from MGI
* C3N-03012
* C3N-03933


## Git strategy

This is a production branch but we want to make some changes with how configuration files laid
out
  * move configuration files to workflow templates
  * Only those config files actually being used here are in ./config directory

As such, this is both a production and development branch.  Idea is this is a short-lived production
branch which will soon merge to master
* Still, best to make a branch - call this `evidence` branch
